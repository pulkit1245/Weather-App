# 🌦️ Jetpack Compose Weather App

This is a fully functional weather application built using **Jetpack Compose**, the modern UI toolkit for Android. The app provides real-time weather data for any searched location and displays it in a clean, intuitive UI enriched with contextual visuals and smart suggestions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Live Weather Data**: Integrates with WeatherAPI to fetch current temperature, humidity, pressure, visibility, UV index, wind speed, cloud cover, and more.
- **Location Search**: Allows users to search for any city or region and instantly fetch weather information.
- **Google Maps Integration**: Displays a map marker for the searched location using Google Maps SDK.
- **Dynamic UI**: Background images and weather suggestions dynamically change based on temperature, condition, and humidity.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts smoothly across various screen sizes and supports animated transitions for enhanced user experience.
- **Weather Suggestions**: Intelligent tips for users based on weather conditions (e.g., "Keep yourself hydrated", "Layer up!").
- **MVVM Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns using Model-View-ViewModel pattern.
- **Modern Android Development**: Built entirely with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin.
